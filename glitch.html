	<h3>This Image before hand was a picture of a single mushroom cloud explosion. After glitching it though the Audacity application it created two more mushroom clouds on each side of it adding more color to it too than the original photo. It reminds me of what it might looks like as if you were there looking through a camera lens off an initial impact of a nuke exploding. I also edited the image in photoshop to add the recording symbol and time to give it a different effect.</h3>

	<h3>With this image I used the TextEdit application to glitch it. Both pictures relate to each other in different ways. It all just depends on what the viewer wants to take from them. One way you can look at this one is how the glitch pixelated everything and changed the colors in a way to make the soldiers now look like youâ€™re seeing them through some type of heat vision camera. I also edited the image in photoshop to add the recording symbol and time to give it a different effect.</h3>
