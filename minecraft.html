	<h3>So at first I was going to go with the original television since it culturally was the beginning of at home entertainment. Once I had built that I came up with the idea of a GameBoy since it related more to me. I grew up loving all sorts of different video games but the GameBoy was always on me at all times. Not only could I bring it on the go with me when we had long family road trips in the car but the games on it (such as PacMan, Tetris and my all time favorite Pokemon) were classics and helped shape the gaming industry is todayâ€™s. These are my two creations and let me know what you think.</h3>
